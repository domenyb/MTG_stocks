Problem statement for this folder:

MTG (Magic: The Gathering) is primarily a game, but some of its cards have huge value behind them. The strength of individual cards in the metagame can greatly influence their (or other cards's) market value.
I've decided to monitor the price of cards in standard-legal sets for a period in time to then use them for a project, since these prices should work very similarly to stock prices. - They can move up or down depending on real-life events or just some cards showing up on tournaments.

Right now I'm in the first phase of the data gathering, I wrote a script that scrapes the prices twice a day - until I have a significant amount of data to examine.
